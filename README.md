# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data, classifying user-generated reviews as either positive or negative. The analysis leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful insights from the given dataset.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Deep Learning models.
- **Data Visualization:** Word clouds, bar charts, and confusion matrices for result interpretation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of user-generated reviews labeled as positive or negative. It includes:
- **Review Text:** The main content to analyze.
- **Sentiment Label:** Binary labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob (for NLP processing)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Installation
To set up the project environment, install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction.
3. Train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Visualize the results.

## Results
The project provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to evaluate model performance. The trained model can be used for real-world applications such as analyzing customer feedback or social media sentiment.

## Future Improvements
- Support for multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., neutral sentiment).
- Integration with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT).
- Deployment as a web application for real-time sentiment analysis.
